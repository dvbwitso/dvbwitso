# Yo, I’m Dabwitso Mweemba! 👋🏾

I’m a **code-wielding Zambian trailblazer**—part software engineer, part problem-slaying geek, and 100% hooked on building the future of Tech in Africa,  Picture this: scalable systems humming like a futuristic drumbeat, innovation sizzling like nsima on a solar grill, and me, pushing the boundaries of what code can do. Let’s vibe and build some *next-level* magic!

## My Superpowers
- **System Sorcerer**: Crafting slick, scalable architectures.
